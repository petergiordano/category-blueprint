# Enhancement Specification: Rename to "Positioning Blueprint"

**Issue Title:** Refactor: Rename "Category Blueprint" to "Positioning Blueprint"

---

## 1. Summary

This enhancement involves a global find-and-replace to rename the project from "Category Blueprint" to "Positioning Blueprint". This change should be reflected in all user-facing content, documentation, and internal code where appropriate.

---

## 2. Scope and Priority

- **High Priority:** All user-visible content across the application's UI and public-facing documentation (`README.md`, etc.).
- **Secondary Priority:** Internal code references, variable names, function names, comments, and internal documentation to ensure consistency and avoid confusion for future development.

---

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

1.  All user-facing instances of "Category Blueprint" in HTML files and UI components are replaced with "Positioning Blueprint".
2.  Key documentation files (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, etc.) are updated to reflect the new name.
3.  Internal code, where the name is used (e.g., variable names, comments), is reviewed and updated for consistency.
4.  The application must build and run without errors after the changes.
5.  The `validate-workflow.sh` script must pass successfully.
