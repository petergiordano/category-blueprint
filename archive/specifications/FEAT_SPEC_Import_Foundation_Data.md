# Feature Specification: Import Foundation Data

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Proposed
**Author:** Gemini

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a new "Import Data" feature within the Category Blueprint application. This feature will allow users to import data for "Part 1: Segment Foundation" from a local JSON file, streamlining the process of populating the form and enabling users to save and reuse their work.

## 2. Objective

The primary objective is to provide users with a way to quickly populate the "Part 1: Segment Foundation" section by uploading a JSON file. This enhances usability by allowing users to work offline, share their foundation data, and easily switch between different foundation setups.

## 3. User Story

As a user, I want to be able to import my Segment Foundation data from a JSON file so that I can easily reuse my previous work, share it with my team, or load a template without having to manually re-enter all the information.

## 4. UI/UX Requirements

### 4.1. "Import Data" Button

-   An "Import Data" button will be added to the main header navigation bar, next to the existing "Export Foundation" button.
-   The button should be styled consistently with the existing buttons in the application.

### 4.2. Import Workflow

1.  **Click "Import Data"**: The user clicks the "Import Data" button.
2.  **File Picker**: The browser's native file picker dialog opens, prompting the user to select a `.json` file.
3.  **File Validation**:
    -   The application will read the selected file.
    -   It will parse the JSON and validate its schema to ensure it matches the data structure required for the Segment Foundation.
4.  **User Feedback**:
    -   **On Success**: If the file is valid, the data is loaded into the application state, and the "Part 1: Segment Foundation" form is populated with the imported values. A success notification (e.g., a toast message) will briefly appear, saying "Foundation data imported successfully."
    -   **On Error (Invalid Schema)**: If the JSON does not match the expected schema, an error message will be displayed. The message should be clear and helpful, for example: "Import failed: The selected file does not match the required data structure. Please check the file and try again."
    -   **On Error (Other)**: For other errors (e.g., file is not valid JSON, file read error), a generic but clear error message should be shown.

### 4.3. User Guidance

To help users create a valid JSON file, the following should be considered:

-   When an import error occurs due to a schema mismatch, provide a modal or a link to a document that displays the expected JSON schema.
-   The existing "Export Foundation" button serves as a natural way for users to generate a correctly formatted JSON file that can be later used for import. The UI text around the import/export buttons should hint at this.

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1. File Handling

-   The application must use the browser's File API to read the content of the user-selected local `.json` file.

### 5.2. Schema Validation

-   A robust validation mechanism must be implemented on the client-side.
-   This validation should check for the presence of all required keys and ensure their values are of the correct data type (e.g., `string`, `array`, `object`).
-   The validation logic should be centralized and easily updatable if the data schema for "Part 1" changes in the future.

### 5.3. State Management

-   Upon successful import and validation, the application's central state (e.g., in a React context or a state management library) must be updated with the new data.
-   This state update must trigger a re-render of the "Part 1: Segment Foundation" component to display the imported data in the form fields.

## 6. Out of Scope

-   This feature will only support importing data for "Part 1: Segment Foundation." Importing data for other parts of the application is not in scope for this iteration.
-   The application will not save the imported file on a server. All processing will be done on the client-side.
