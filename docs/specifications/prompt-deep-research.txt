### 3A. Competitive Alternatives

**Synthesis:** The primary competitive alternative for [Product or Service Name] is not another software vendor, but rather the internal status quo of using manual processes built around spreadsheets and email. This approach is chosen for its perceived low cost and familiarity, but its primary weakness is its inability to scale, leading to significant error rates and compliance risks.

-   **Alternative:** Manual Processes (Status Quo)
    -   **Weakness/Gap:** Manual review is completely unscalable, highly prone to human error, and provides zero visibility into actual workflows, making process improvement impossible. [Source: G2 Review for Competitor X, 2025-08-15]
