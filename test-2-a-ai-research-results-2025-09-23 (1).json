            "definition": "Regie.ai defines a new set of expectations where its unique attributes—particularly the unified human-Agent workflow and the consolidated platform model—become the defining features. This forces legacy SEPs like Salesloft and Outreach to be evaluated against these new standards, effectively positioning them as the \"old way\" of doing things and creating a distinct market space for RegieOne to own."

          "manifesto": "Regie.ai's messaging is built on three consistent pillars. The first, \"Unify & Consolidate,\" targets the operational and financial pain of tech stack complexity. The second, \"Human-Agent Collaboration,\" explains the novel workflow and the intelligent division of labor between AI and reps. The third, \"Smarter, Relevant Engagement,\" focuses on the superior outcome of this new process: a better, more personalized experience for the buyer.",
