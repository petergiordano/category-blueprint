**Objective:** Implement a new feature in the `CompanySetupModal` to generate a consistent, high-quality deep-research prompt. This implementation must be robust to ensure the prompt's structure is identical every time.

**File to Modify:** `index.html`
**File to Reference:** `docs/specifications/prompt-deep-research.md`

**Detailed Implementation Steps:**

**1. Create a Dedicated "Prompt Engine" Helper Function:**
* Inside the main `<script type="text/babel">` tag, create a new, standalone helper function: `generateDeepResearchPrompt(companyData)`.
* This function will accept one argument: a `companyData` object (e.g., `{ companyName: 'Klarity', productName: 'Architect', ... }`).
* **Inside this function:**
    * It must first read the entire contents of the file at **`docs/specifications/prompt-deep-research.md`** into a template string.
    * It will then systematically replace a predefined set of placeholders in the template (e.g., `[Company Name]`, `[Product/Service Name]`) with the corresponding values from the `companyData` object.
    * It must include error handling or default values for any missing data to ensure the final string is never broken.
    * It will `return` the final, populated prompt string.

**2. Add the "Generate Research Prompt" Button to the UI:**
* In the `CompanySetupModal` component, add a new button with the text "Generate Deep Research Prompt".
* The button should be `disabled` until all required fields in the modal are filled.

**3. Implement the `onClick` Handler with Validation:**
* The `onClick` handler for the new button will orchestrate the process:
    * **First, it must perform input validation.** Check that the required fields (Company Name, Website, Product Name) in the modal's state are not empty.
    * If validation passes, it will create a `companyData` object from the modal's state.
    * It will then call our new `generateDeepResearchPrompt(companyData)` helper function to get the final prompt string.
    * Finally, it will open a new "Prompt Display Modal" (which you will create next) and pass the generated prompt string to it.

**4. Create the "Prompt Display Modal" Component:**
* Create a new React component named `PromptDisplayModal`.
* The modal should display the generated prompt text in a large, read-only `<textarea>`.
* It must include both a **"Copy to Clipboard"** button and a **"Download as .txt"** button to give the user options for exporting the prompt.
* It must include a "Close" button.

**5. Wire Everything Together:**
* Use React state in the main `App` component to manage the visibility of the `PromptDisplayModal` and to hold the generated prompt text.

**Final Result:**
This implementation ensures a consistent and reliable process. The `generateDeepResearchPrompt` function acts as a centralized engine, guaranteeing that every prompt generated by the application has the exact same structure and quality, regardless of the input data.
