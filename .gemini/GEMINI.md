## Gemini Project Context

### Project: category-blueprint

This project is a production-ready template for creating AI-powered, command-line development workflows.

### Key Characteristics:

*   **AI-Powered Workflow**: Leverages AI, specifically with tools like Gyro, for development tasks.
*   **Spec-Driven Development**: The workflow is heavily guided by documentation, particularly the Product Requirements Document (`PRD.md`).
*   **Component Architecture**: The system is designed as a pipeline of 4-8 distinct, command-line components, each following the "Simple, Lovable, and Complete" (SLC) principle.
*   **Automation**: Includes scripts for validation, testing, and quality assurance.
*   **Technology**: Primarily a Python-based project, but the template is flexible enough to accommodate Go or JavaScript. It is intended for building command-line interface (CLI) tools.

### Development Philosophy:

*   **Function Over Fashion**: Prioritizes creating functional, iterative, and valuable command-line tools over developing complex user interfaces.
*   **Simple, Lovable, and Complete (SLC)**: Each component should be simple, reliable, and fully functional for its defined purpose.

### Current State:

The repository is a template and requires customization for a specific project. The `PRD.md` and other specification documents need to be filled out to define the vision, goals, and components of the target system.
