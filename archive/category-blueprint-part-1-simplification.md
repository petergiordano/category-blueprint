# Home Screen

Remove the "Analyze with AI" button.
Ensure the user is prompted to do the company setup.
Eliminate the screen after the home screen that says company analysis. And then it shows the company name and URL. And then it has a green button with analyze company and generate JTBD framework. You can just eliminate this whole page and the ai analysis.


# Part 1: Segment Foundation

## Subsection: Jobs to be Done

- Clean up the JTBD Elements. Remove the blue button "Validate against MArket" for each of the 9 JTBD Elements. What should remain is the following:

    JTBD Element Name
    Short description
    Text Box with Example text

    For example:
        Anxieties & Habits
        Concerns about adopting something new, and inertia with current processes/tools.
        Fear of migration failure; comfort with spreadsheet.

## Subsection: Customer value

- Remove the blue button that says Analyze JTBD and Draft Customer Value. You can also remove the light blue shaded box that says AI Customer Value Drafter.

- Create entry fields for Customer Value.  Follow the same pattern as jobs to be done and create the following entries for the 5 elements of customer value. 

    Table Stakes
    The non-negotiables for credibility and trust. Baseline requirements.
    Example: SOC2 certification; ERP integration; 99.9% uptime SLAs.
    
    Functional Value
    Tangible, measurable outcomes—ROI, efficiency, cost savings, growth, or risk mitigation.
    Example: $500K OpEx savings from faster close cycles and fewer errors.
    
    Ease of Doing Business
    How simple you make adoption and daily use. Less friction wins.
    Example: Fast implementation playbook; role-based onboarding; 24/7 enterprise support.
    
    Individual Value
    What matters to each buyer personally—status, workload relief, confidence, or career gains.
    Example: CFO is seen as innovator; IT leader feels secure; end users save hours.
    
    Aspirational Value
    Alignment with higher-order goals and purpose. Motivations beyond rational ROI.
    Example: Supports ESG reporting; signals innovation to board and investors.
    
## Subsection: Willingness to Pay

- Remove the orange button labeled "Generate JTBD Drivers"

- Create entry fields for Willingness to Pay. Follow the same pattern as jobs to be done and customer value and create the following entries for the 5 elements of Willingness to Pay.


    Ability to Pay
    Whether the customer has budget and capacity to spend. Even strong solutions fail without funding.
    Example: Line item already approved in FY25 budget for compliance automation.
    
    Economic Justification
    Whether the ROI and payback case makes financial sense. Customers want proof it pays for itself.
    Example: Pays for itself in under 12 months through $1M annual cost avoidance.
    
    Relative Value vs. Alternatives
    How your solution compares to competitors or the status quo. Clear differentiation increases willingness to pay.
    Example: Automates 80% of manual work versus consultant-heavy models.
    
    Risk & Switching Costs
    How much risk or friction they see in making the change. Higher risk lowers willingness; mitigation raises it.
    Example: Migration takes days, not months; vendor assumes implementation risk.
    
    Market Reference Points
    The pricing anchors customers bring from prior spend or competitors. Buyers benchmark against “similar” tools.
    Example: Analytics platforms in this space usually run $100K–$150K annually.

- Add a navigation button at the bottom of the page after the willingness to pay subsection. the button should say "Continue to Part 2: ICP Definition"
