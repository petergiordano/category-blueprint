Interactive Category Blueprint - User Guide

Getting Started
Access the app: https://category-blueprint.vercel.app/

Step 1: Company Setup
1. Enter your company information in the welcome screen:
   - Company name
   - Website URL
   - Product/service name
   - Industry
2. Click "Continue" to proceed to the main application

Step 2: Download & Prepare Import Files
1. Save the attached imports.zip file to your computer
2. Unzip the file - this will create three JSON files:
   - 1-segment-foundation-import-klarity.json
   - 2-icp-definition-import-klarity.json
   - 3-positioning-import-klarity.json

Step 3: Using the Import Feature (Optional Fast-Track)
If you want to skip manual data entry for Parts 1-3, you can import pre-filled templates:

For each part you want to import:
1. Navigate to the specific part (Part 1: Segment Foundation, Part 2: ICP Definition, or Part 3: Positioning)
2. Click the "Import Data" button (located in the top-right of each section)
3. Select the corresponding file from the unzipped files:
   - Part 1: Use 1-segment-foundation-import-klarity.json
   - Part 2: Use 2-icp-definition-import-klarity.json
   - Part 3: Use 3-positioning-import-klarity.json
4. Verify the import - You'll see a success message and the form will populate with the imported data
5. Review and customize the imported data as needed for your specific situation

Step 4: Manual Entry (Alternative)
If you prefer to fill out the forms manually or want to customize beyond the imported templates:
- Part 1: Define your market segments and target characteristics
- Part 2: Create your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
- Part 3: Develop your positioning strategy

Step 5: Part 4 - Category Design
Part 4 will be completed together during our workshop session on Thursday. No import file is provided for this section as we'll work through it collaboratively.
