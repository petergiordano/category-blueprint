# Positioning Methodology: A Three-Stage Framework

**From Market Segments to Strategic Positioning**

This document describes the comprehensive methodology for determining foundational segments, creating Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs), and developing strategic positioning.

---

## Overview

Your positioning methodology is a systematic, three-stage process that transforms market understanding into actionable positioning:

1. **Stage 1**: Foundational Segments (Jobs-to-be-Done, Value, Willingness to Pay)
2. **Stage 2**: Actionable ICP (Strategic Why + Operational Where)
3. **Stage 3**: Positioning Framework (Competitive context, unique value, market category)

Each stage builds on the previous, creating a coherent narrative from market → segment → ICP → positioning.

---

## Stage 1: Foundational Segments (Part 1 - Segment Foundation)

### Purpose
Determine foundational market segments by filtering the total addressable market through three critical lenses that identify customers who share common characteristics.

### The Three Filters

#### 1. Jobs-to-be-Done (Shared Context & Problems)

Identify customers who share the same fundamental problems and motivations:

- **Context**: The business situation or operating environment
  - *Example*: "Quarterly close process across distributed finance teams"

- **Struggling Moments**: Breakdowns, inefficiencies, or risks triggering the search
  - *Example*: "Errors in revenue recognition delaying financial reporting"

- **Pushes & Pulls**: Forces moving customers toward or away from change
  - *Example*: "CFO pressure to modernize systems vs. IT reluctance to add new vendors"

- **Anxieties & Habits**: Concerns about adoption and inertia with current processes
  - *Example*: "Fear of migration failure; comfort with spreadsheets"

- **Desired Outcomes**: What customers hope to achieve
  - *Example*: "Reduce audit prep time by 50%; ensure SOX compliance"

- **Basic Quality/Table Stakes**: Minimum standards for consideration
  - *Example*: "SOC2 compliance, API integrations with ERP, enterprise-grade security"

- **Hiring Criteria**: What makes them select one vendor
  - *Example*: "Proven implementation playbook; reference customers in financial services"

- **Firing Criteria**: What gets a vendor rejected or replaced
  - *Example*: "System downtime; lack of role-based access control"

- **Key Trade-offs**: Acceptable compromises
  - *Example*: "May sacrifice customization for faster time to value"

#### 2. Customer Value (Similar Value Priorities)

Using a five-level value hierarchy to identify customers who prioritize similar value dimensions:

- **Table Stakes**: Non-negotiable baseline requirements (credibility, trust)
  - *Example*: "SOC2 certification; ERP integration; 99.9% uptime SLAs"

- **Functional Value**: Tangible, measurable outcomes (ROI, efficiency, cost savings)
  - *Example*: "$500K OpEx savings from faster close cycles and fewer errors"

- **Ease of Doing Business**: Simplicity in adoption and daily use (lower friction)
  - *Example*: "Fast implementation playbook; role-based onboarding; 24/7 enterprise support"

- **Individual Value**: Personal benefits to buyers (status, workload relief, confidence)
  - *Example*: "CFO is seen as innovator; IT leader feels secure; end users save hours"

- **Aspirational Value**: Alignment with higher-order goals and purpose
  - *Example*: "Supports ESG reporting; signals innovation to board and investors"

#### 3. Willingness to Pay (Investment Threshold)

Identify customers who have both the ability and economic justification to invest:

- **Ability to Pay**: Budget and capacity to spend
  - *Example*: "Line item already approved in FY25 budget for compliance automation"

- **Economic Justification**: ROI and payback case
  - *Example*: "Pays for itself in under 12 months through $1M annual cost avoidance"

- **Relative Value vs. Alternatives**: Differentiation from competitors
  - *Example*: "Automates 80% of manual work versus consultant-heavy models"

- **Risk & Switching Costs**: Friction in making the change
  - *Example*: "Migration takes days, not months; vendor assumes implementation risk"

- **Market Reference Points**: Pricing anchors from prior spend or competitors
  - *Example*: "Analytics platforms in this space usually run $100K–$150K annually"

### Visual Representation

The Segment Funnel Diagram shows this as a filtering funnel:

```
Total Market
    ↓
[Jobs-to-be-Done Filter]
    ↓
[Value Recognition Filter]
    ↓
[Willingness to Pay Filter]
    ↓
Market Segment (Foundational)
```

**Key Insight**: Customers in the same segment share the same jobs-to-be-done, similar value priorities, and comparable willingness to pay. This creates a cohesive group for targeted messaging and product development.

---

## Stage 2: Actionable ICP (Part 2 - ICP Definition)

### Purpose
Transform the Market Segment into an **Actionable ICP** by adding targeting characteristics that enable both strategic positioning and operational execution.

### The Strategic Bridge: Product/Business Model Fit

Before defining the ICP, validate:
- Your offering aligns with customer needs from the Market Segment
- Your business model supports serving this segment profitably

### Two Dimensions of ICP

#### Strategic Why (For Messaging & Positioning)

**Purpose**: Understand the deeper motivations and strategic value drivers

- **Quick Decision Making**: Who is the economic buyer and can they approve efficiently?
  - *Example*: "The VP of Finance is the economic buyer. They have budget authority up to $250k for transformation projects and can sign off without a lengthy committee review."

- **Prioritized Requirements**: What do they value most in a solution?
  - *Example*: "Speed-to-insight is #1. We cannot wait 6 months for consultants. #2 is accuracy; the data must be audit-grade. #3 is ease of use for our internal team."

- **Implementation Readiness**: Can they adopt and get value today?
  - *Example*: "They have a dedicated transformation team ready to start. All relevant contracts and process documents are digitized and accessible."

#### Operational Where (For Targeting & Campaigns)

**Purpose**: Define tactical attributes for finding and reaching prospects

- **Firmographic**: Company attributes (size, industry, revenue)
  - *Example*: "Publicly traded B2B SaaS company, >$1B in annual revenue, 2000+ employees. Headquartered in North America."

- **Technographic**: Current technology stack
  - *Example*: "Currently using NetSuite, Salesforce, and Coupa. Moving to Oracle Fusion. Internal BI uses Tableau."

- **Behavioral**: How they act, buy, and use technology
  - *Example*: "They are early adopters of AI technology in their finance stack. They prefer to buy best-of-breed solutions over suite extensions. They have a history of successful, large-scale software implementations."

### Visual Representation

The ICP Flow Diagram shows the transformation:

```
Market Segment Foundation
(JTBD, Value, WTP)
    ↓
[Product/Business Model Fit]
    ↓
    ├─→ Strategic Why (Messaging & Positioning)
    │   • Quick Decision Making
    │   • Prioritized Requirements
    │   • Implementation Readiness
    │
    └─→ Operational Where (Targeting & Campaigns)
        • Firmographic
        • Technographic
        • Behavioral
    ↓
Actionable ICP
```

**Key Insight**: The ICP has two distinct purposes:
- **Strategic Why** informs messaging, positioning, and product development
- **Operational Where** enables precise targeting in marketing and sales campaigns

---

## Stage 3: Positioning Framework (Part 3 - Positioning)

### Purpose
Using your Actionable ICP, develop positioning that differentiates your solution and communicates unique value within a defined market category.

### The Five Components

#### 1. Competitive Alternatives Analysis

**Purpose**: Understand what customers currently use and why they might switch

For each alternative, document:
- **Alternative Name**: The solution customers currently use
  - *Example*: "Excel spreadsheets, Tableau, PowerBI"

- **Why Customers Choose This**: Current appeal
  - *Example*: "Low cost, simplicity, familiarity"

- **Weaknesses/Gaps**: Where alternatives fall short
  - *Example*: "Time-consuming, prone to errors, limited scalability"

- **Customer Proof**: Evidence from real customers
  - *Example*: "3 Fortune 500 companies mentioned frustration with manual reconciliation in interviews"

#### 2. Unique Value & Proof

**Purpose**: Articulate what makes your solution uniquely valuable

For each differentiator, follow the Attribute → Benefit → Value chain:

- **Attribute**: Your unique capability
  - *Example*: "AI-powered reconciliation engine"

- **Attribute Description**: Detailed explanation
  - *Example*: "Machine learning algorithms trained on 10M+ transactions that automatically match and reconcile financial records across multiple systems"

- **Benefit**: Customer impact
  - *Example*: "Reduces manual reconciliation work by 80%"

- **Value/Proof**: Measurable outcome
  - *Example*: "$500K annual savings; 5-day close cycle reduced to 2 days (verified with 12 customers)"

**Quality Standards**:
- Attributes should be specific and defensible
- Benefits should explain clear customer impact
- Value should include quantifiable outcomes or proof points

#### 3. Market Category Definition

**Purpose**: Define how customers and analysts will categorize your solution

- **Market Context**: Your market positioning strategy
  - Options: New Category, Existing Category, Sub-category, Other
  - *Example*: "Sub-category" (AI-powered financial close automation within broader finance automation market)

- **Category Name**: Your chosen category label
  - *Example*: "Intelligent Financial Close Platform"

**Category Strategy Considerations**:
- **New Category**: Requires significant market education, but can establish leadership
- **Existing Category**: Faster market understanding, but more competition
- **Sub-category**: Balances specificity with market familiarity

#### 4. Target Market Characteristics

**Purpose**: Connect positioning back to your ICP for consistency

Display ICP elements from Part 2:
- Firmographic attributes
- Technographic characteristics
- Behavioral signals
- Decision-making dynamics
- Implementation readiness

**Key Insight**: This section ensures your positioning aligns with who you're actually targeting.

#### 5. Relevant Trends

**Purpose**: Create urgency by connecting to macro market forces

Document up to 4 industry trends that make your solution timely:

- **Trend 1**: *Example*: "AI automation is becoming table stakes in enterprise software"
- **Trend 2**: *Example*: "Remote work is driving demand for cloud-based collaboration"
- **Trend 3**: *Example*: "Regulatory compliance requirements are becoming more stringent"

---

## Key Differentiators of This Approach

### 1. Jobs-to-be-Done Foundation
Start with customer problems and context, not company features. This ensures product-market fit is validated before positioning decisions.

### 2. Five-Level Value Hierarchy
Go beyond functional ROI to include:
- Baseline requirements (Table Stakes)
- Operational efficiency (Functional Value, Ease of Doing Business)
- Human factors (Individual Value)
- Purpose alignment (Aspirational Value)

### 3. Willingness to Pay as Filter
Economic viability is a segmentation criterion, not an afterthought. This prevents pursuing segments that won't pay appropriately.

### 4. Strategic + Operational ICP
Separate "why" (messaging) from "where" (targeting):
- **Strategic Why** informs product development and positioning
- **Operational Where** enables precise campaign execution

### 5. Evidence-Based Positioning
Customer proof and validation throughout:
- Validation of JTBD with market language analysis
- Customer quotes in competitive alternatives
- Quantified outcomes in value propositions
- Trend data from analyst reports

### 6. Visual Learning System
Interactive diagrams make abstract concepts concrete:
- Filtering funnel shows segment refinement
- Flow diagram shows ICP development
- Progressive disclosure builds understanding systematically

### 7. Progressive Methodology
Each stage builds on the previous:
```
Market Understanding
    ↓
Segment Definition
    ↓
ICP Creation
    ↓
Strategic Positioning
```

This creates a coherent narrative where every positioning decision traces back to validated customer insights.
