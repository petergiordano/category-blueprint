# AI Context for Interactive GTM Blueprint

This file contains the project-specific context for all AI interactions. Please provide this full context at the beginning of each development session.

## Project Overview
- **Project Purpose:** To enhance the "Interactive GTM Blueprint Series" SPA by integrating a set of "AI Quick Wins"â€”small, high-impact features that provide intelligent feedback to the user.
- **Target Users:** B2B SaaS founders and go-to-market leaders.
- **Key Features:** F-1 (AI Category Name Brainstormer), F-2 (Value Proposition Grader), F-3 (Competitive Weakness Analysis), F-4 (AI-Assisted JTBD Structuring), F-5 (Uniqueness Attribute Validation), F-6 (Trend Validation).

## Architecture Decisions
- **Technology Stack:** The entire application is a single `index.html` file using React, Babel, and Tailwind CSS loaded via CDN. There is no build step.
- **Design Patterns:** Component-based architecture within a single file. State is managed via React hooks and persisted to localStorage.
- **Integration Approaches:** AI features will be implemented via client-side JavaScript, simulating API calls initially.

## Development Status

- **Completed Components:** Features F-1 (AI Category Name Brainstormer), F-2 (Value Proposition Grader), F-3 (Competitive Weakness Analysis), and F-4 (AI-Assisted JTBD Structuring) have been successfully implemented and validated.
- **Active Development Area:** Phase 1 AI Quick Wins (F-1, F-2, F-3, F-4) are complete. Ready to begin Phase 2 with F-5 (Uniqueness Attribute Validation) or F-6 (Trend Validation). All work is on the `feature/ai-quick-wins` git branch.
- **Planned Features:** F-5 and F-6 require web search API integration and represent Phase 2 of the AI Quick Wins implementation.

## Lessons Learned
- **Implementation Insights:** Parallel development with multiple AI Implementers in a single, shared workspace can lead to git state conflicts (e.g., incorrect branch usage). A sequential, single-Implementer workflow is more reliable for this setup.
- **Best Practices:** All coding tasks should begin with creating a dedicated feature branch and end with a commit to that branch.

## AI Coordination Notes
- **Effective Prompting:** Use this context file as a prefix for every new session with an Implementer. Follow up with a single, clear, step-by-step prompt for the immediate task.
- **Workflow:** We are manually executing the cycle described in `WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`. Our current actions are equivalent to the implementation phase for the `@next-task`.

## Agent Handoff & Status Log

**Timestamp:** 2025-08-26T18:30:00Z
**From:** Claude-Code
**To:** Gemini-CLI
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Summary:** The simulated AI brainstorming for Feature F-1 is complete. I have implemented the state management, context gathering, and a simulated API function with a loading state. The UI now displays generated category names based on user's strategic input. The work has been committed to the `feature/ai-quick-wins` branch. The `index.html` file is ready for your review.

**Timestamp:** 2025-08-27T18:45:00Z
**From:** Claude-Code
**To:** User/Gemini-CLI
**Status:** PROTOCOL UPDATE COMPLETE
**Summary:** Fixed three-way collaboration protocol implementation. Updated CLAUDE.md to reference correct directory (.aicontext/ with hyphen, not .ai_context/ with underscore). Removed incorrect file created in wrong directory. Protocol now properly institutionalized - future Claude sessions will automatically read .aicontext/context.md on startup and follow handoff procedures. Ready for continued F-2 and F-3 implementation.

**Timestamp:** 2025-08-27T19:30:00Z
**From:** Claude-Code
**To:** User/Gemini-CLI
**Status:** F-2 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
**Summary:** Feature F-2 (Value Proposition Grader) has been successfully implemented. Added simulateAIGrading function with realistic scoring algorithm that analyzes Attribute, Benefit, and Value quality. RemovableTriple component now includes grading functionality with loading states, color-coded grade display (A-F), and detailed feedback. The system evaluates completeness, specificity, quantifiable outcomes, and business value articulation. All changes committed to feature/ai-quick-wins branch. Ready for F-3 implementation or testing phase.

**Timestamp:** 2025-08-27T20:00:00Z
**From:** Gemini-CLI
**To:** Claude-Code
**Status:** TASK ASSIGNED
**Branch:** feature/ai-quick-wins
**Summary:** Feature F-2 has been validated. The next task is to begin Feature F-3 (Competitive Weakness Analysis). The assignment is to implement a simulated AI analysis based on the spec in `docs/specifications/TASK_LIST_AI_Quick_Wins.md`.

**Timestamp:** 2025-08-27T20:15:00Z
**From:** Claude-Code
**To:** User/Gemini-CLI
**Status:** F-3 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
**Branch:** feature/ai-quick-wins
**Summary:** Feature F-3 (Competitive Weakness Analysis) has been successfully implemented. Added simulateCompetitiveAnalysis function that analyzes competitor weaknesses (slow, expensive, complex, limited) and generates 3-4 contextual strategic talking points. Enhanced RemovableRow component with Analyze Weakness button, loading states, and expandable results display. Includes copy-to-clipboard functionality and blue-themed styling consistent with Scale brand. All three AI Quick Wins features (F-1, F-2, F-3) are now complete. Ready for final testing, brand validation, or production deployment.

**From:** Gemini-CLI
**To:** User
**Status:** VALIDATION PHASE START
**Branch:** feature/ai-quick-wins
**Summary:** I have validated the implementation of F-3. All features (F-1, F-2, F-3) are now implemented. The project is ready for the validation phase, starting with Brand Compliance Validation as per the spec.

**Timestamp:** 2025-08-27T21:15:00Z
**From:** Claude-Code
**To:** User/Gemini-CLI
**Status:** DIRECTORY RENAME TASK COMPLETE
**Branch:** feature/ai-quick-wins
**Summary:** Successfully completed the comprehensive search and replace task started by Gemini CLI. Replaced all occurrences of .ai-context/ with .aicontext/ and AI_CONTEXT.md with context.md across the project. Files updated: scripts/initialize-project.sh (completed 7 remaining replacements), scripts/validate-setup.py (2 replacements), and TEMPLATE_SETUP.md (3 replacements). The directory structure migration from .ai-context/ to .aicontext/ is now complete and all references have been updated consistently throughout the codebase.

**Status:** F-4 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
**Branch:** feature/ai-quick-wins
**Summary:** Successfully implemented Feature F-4 (AI-Assisted JTBD Structuring) with bottom-up breadcrumb approach. Added JTBDModal component with 8 formal JTBD elements, implemented simulateJTBDAnalysis function that identifies signals/breadcrumbs in text and clusters them, added Analyze JTBD button to Section 1 Common Needs textarea, and created Save Structured JTBD functionality. The modal displays original text alongside editable analysis fields. Implementation follows master GTM prompt methodology and Scale brand guidelines. Phase 1 AI Quick Wins (F-1, F-2, F-3, F-4) are now complete. Ready for Phase 2 (F-5, F-6) which require web search API integration.
