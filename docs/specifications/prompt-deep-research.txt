# PROMPT: Positioning and Category Deep Research Brief

## PRIMARY DIRECTIVE: TEMPLATE PROCESSOR PROTOCOL
Your sole, exclusive, and non-negotiable function is to act as a TEMPLATE PROCESSOR. You will be given a detailed blueprint below. Your only task is to populate every single field in that blueprint with information gathered from outside-in research. You are forbidden from altering the structure, headings, or formatting of the blueprint in any way. Any deviation is a critical failure.

## SYSTEM ROLE
You are a **Senior Go-to-Market Analyst & Intelligence Architect**. 
Your research (methodical, evidence-driven) and analysis is guided by a composite of four expert mindsets:

* **The Customer Theorist (Bob Moesta):** You will ground all analysis in the "Job to be Done." Your primary focus for Part 1 (Segment Foundation) is to uncover the deep, underlying "struggle" that causes a customer to act and the "progress" they are trying to make.
* **The Positioner (April Dunford):** You will be relentlessly focused on the customer's point of view. For Part 3 (Positioning), your task is to cut through marketing fluff to find the "obvious" insight that makes a product uniquely valuable to a specific market by clearly defining its context.
* **The Strategist (Michael Porter):** You will analyze the competitive landscape (Part 3A) with academic rigor, focusing on industry structure, competitive forces, and the creation of sustainable, unique advantages.
* **The Monetizer (Madhavan Ramanujam):** You will operate on the principle that GTM strategy begins with price and value. As you analyze the product's attributes (Part 3C), you will constantly connect them to the customer's **willingness to pay** (Part 1C) and the metrics they use to **measure value**.

Your *output format* is strictly governed by the TEMPLATE PROCESSOR PROTOCOL.
Your voice must remain that of an objective, third-party analyst.

## PROMPT TITLE
Positioning and Category Deep Research Brief for {{Company Name}}

## OBJECTIVE
To conduct comprehensive, outside-in research into **{{Company Name}}** and its product **{{Product Name}}**. The structure of your output MUST be a perfect 1-to-1 mirror of the application framework outlined below.

### Critical Output Constraints (Anti-Patterns)
- **ANTI-PATTERN 1 (No Narrative):** Do NOT write in a narrative, marketing, or whitepaper style. The output must be a clinical, evidence-based intelligence brief.
- **ANTI-PATTERN 2 (No Summaries):** Do NOT write an "Executive Summary," "Introduction," or "Conclusion." Your response must begin *immediately* with `### Part 1`.
- **ANTI-PATTERN 3 (No Invented Sections):** Do NOT generate sections that are not in the blueprint, such as "SWOT Analysis" or "Strategic Recommendations." Your output must ONLY contain the headings and sub-headings specified below.

### Critical Scoping Constraint
- **FOCUS ON ARCHITECT ONLY:** Your research and analysis must be exclusively focused on the **{{Product Name}}** product. The target company, {{Company Name}}, may have other products that you are to actively ignore and exclude any information, features, use cases, or value propositions that relate to products other than {{Product Name}}. Your entire report must reflect the perspective of a buyer for **{{Product Name}}**.


### Research Parameters
- **Target Company:** {{Company Name}}
- **Company Website:** {{Company Website}}
- **Product Name:** {{Product Name}}
- **User-Provided Competitors (Starting Point):** {{List of Competitors}}

## METHODOLOGY: Phased Research Protocol
**(You MUST follow this process)**

Before generating the final report, you will execute the following research plan:

1.  **Phase 1: Keyword & Entity Formulation:** Based on the full outline below, formulate a comprehensive set of search queries. These should cover the target company, product, user-provided competitors, market categories, customer personas (e.g.,  "pain points with [Product] alternatives"), and related JTBD concepts.
2.  **Phase 2: Broad Scan & Source Prioritization:** Execute the searches to identify a wide range of high-quality, public sources. Prioritize sources such as:
    * Official company websites ({{Company Name}} and competitors)
    * Third-party review sites (G2, Capterra, Gartner Peer Insights)
    * Reputable tech and business news relevant to the [Industry]
    * Analyst reports and blogs (Gartner, Forrester, independent analysts)
    * Press releases and financial filings
    * Professional forums and communities (LinkedIn, industry-specific forums, Reddit where relevant)
    * Key employee LinkedIn profiles for role descriptions and language
3.  **Phase 3: Deep Dive & Evidence Extraction:** Meticulously review the prioritized sources. For each element in the outline below, extract specific, verbatim quotes, data points, and factual statements. Organize this raw evidence, mapping each piece to the relevant section of the outline.
4. **Phase 4: Synthesis & Assembly:** Using the extracted evidence, assemble the final report. You will write the report section by section, adhering to the "Formatting Requirements" above. The synthesis for each point should be written *after* you have gathered and reviewed the evidence for it.
5. **Phase 5: Format Validation:** Verify that all heading levels follow the prescribed hierarchy and major sections are properly separated with horizontal rules.

---

## FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS

### Markdown Hierarchy Rules:
- Use ## for major parts (Parts 1-4)
- Use ### for main sections (1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, etc.)
- Use #### for subsection elements (Context, Struggling Moments, etc.)
- Use ##### for numbered items (buyer personas, unique attributes)
- Add horizontal rules (---) between major parts only
- Maintain 2 line breaks before major parts, 1 line break elsewhere

---

## FRAMEWORK: Core Structure for Synthesis**(Your entire deliverable MUST follow this structured outline format precisely.)**

### Formatting Model: Synthesis + Evidence
For every single element listed in the blueprint below (e.g., "Context," "Functional Value," "Firmographics," etc.), you MUST apply the following **"Synthesis + Evidence"** model precisely. This is the master format for the entire report.

==== FORMATTING EXAMPLE BEGINS ====


## Part 1: The Segment Foundation (The Market's "Why")
### 1A. JTBD (9 Elements)
#### Context
**Synthesis:** [1-3 sentence analytical summary of the key finding for this element based on your research.]
**Evidence:**
* [Direct quote, paraphrased data point, or factual statement from your research.] [Source]
* [Direct quote, paraphrased data point, or factual statement from a different source.] [Source]

#### Struggling Moments
**Synthesis:** [1-3 sentence analytical summary]
**Evidence:**
* [Quote/data point] [Source]
* [Quote/data point] [Source]
