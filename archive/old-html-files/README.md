# Archived HTML Files

This directory contains old HTML files that were used during development but should NOT be used as source for the Technical Foundation Epic migration.

## Files:
- `index 4.html` - An older development version (not to be used)
- `category_blueprint.html` - Old naming convention file
- `positioning2x2sim.html` - Standalone simulator file

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT
**DO NOT USE THESE FILES AS SOURCE**

The correct source file for migration is:
- **`index-main.html`** - The production version from the main branch

All component migrations for the Technical Foundation Epic should reference `index-main.html` located in the project root.
