        "Context": "Enterprise GTM teams operate in complex, multi-stakeholder environments where they must coordinate across multiple departments, manage extensive compliance requirements, and demonstrate clear ROI on seven-figure technology investments while competing against established incumbents with decades of market presence.",
        "Struggling Moments": "The critical struggle occurs when existing solutions fail to scale with enterprise growth, leading to data fragmentation across 20+ tools, compliance vulnerabilities, and inability to provide unified reporting to C-suite executives who demand real-time visibility into global operations.",
        "Pushes & Pulls": "Teams are pushed away from legacy systems by escalating maintenance costs (often exceeding $5M annually), security breaches, and inability to integrate with modern AI capabilities. They're pulled toward next-generation platforms promising 70% cost reduction, unified data architecture, and AI-driven predictive analytics.",
        "Anxieties & Habits": "Primary anxieties center on data migration risks for petabytes of historical data, potential business disruption during 18-month implementations, and career risk for decision-makers championing change. Organizational habits include quarterly business reviews, annual vendor assessments, and reliance on trusted system integrators.",
        "Desired Outcomes": "Enterprises seek to achieve 40% improvement in sales velocity, reduce operational costs by $2M annually, ensure 99.99% uptime SLAs, maintain SOC2 and ISO27001 compliance, and provide board-ready analytics dashboards that demonstrate competitive advantage through technology.",

        "Key Trade-offs": "Enterprises accept 18-month implementation timelines and $500K+ professional services costs in exchange for transformational capabilities. They trade familiar but limited legacy systems for powerful but complex modern platforms requiring significant change management investment."
