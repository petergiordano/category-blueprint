      "trend1": "The major market trend shifting from simple task automation to strategic process reinvention directly aligns with and enhances Klarity Architect's core value proposition. The product is not merely a tool for documenting existing processes faster; its purpose is to provide the analytical foundation—the \"AI-built roadmaps and desired states\"—to fundamentally redesign how work is done. This positions Klarity as a key enabler of this strategic shift, moving it from a tactical tool to a platform for transformation.",
      "trend2": "The convergence of AI with the rapidly growing process intelligence market makes Klarity's unique approach more appealing. While traditional process mining relies on structured event logs from IT systems, Klarity Architect offers a novel, more human-centric method of discovery by analyzing unstructured data like video walkthroughs. This can be perceived as a faster and more accessible way to gain deep process insights, especially for workflows that are not fully captured in system logs.",
      "trend3": "The trend of AI becoming a strategic imperative for the modern finance function creates significant urgency for a solution like Klarity. CFOs are now expected by their boards and investors to be technology leaders who can leverage AI to control costs, manage risk, and drive growth. This top-down pressure forces finance leaders to move beyond experimentation and find production-grade AI solutions that can deliver measurable results, creating a receptive and urgent market for Klarity's offerings.",
      "trend4": "The overarching trend of AI reshaping the future of work fundamentally impacts the need for Klarity by validating its core premise: that routine, knowledge-based tasks will and should be automated, freeing up human talent for work that requires judgment, creativity, and empathy. As AI automates roles in accounting, data analysis, and customer support, the underlying need is not just to replace tasks but to create new, more efficient human-AI collaboration models, which is precisely what Klarity's \"AI business analyst\" concept enables."
