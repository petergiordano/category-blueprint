**Status:** FEATURE_COMPLETE
**Branch:** feature/positioning-revamp
**Summary:** Fixed SEG-FEAT-007 (AI-Powered Category Drafter) - replaced mock simulation with real API integration.
**Technical Details:**

- **Files Modified**: index.html:3122-3161 (CategoryDesignTool component)
- **Functions Added**: `handleGenerateCategory()` with proper API integration replacing `simulateAIBrainstorming()`
- **AI State Variables**: Added `aiCategoryLoading`, `aiCategoryError` state management
- **API Integration**: Real POST to `/api/draft-category` with context payload (icpSummary, valueProps, fromStatement, toStatement)
- **Theme Fix**: Changed Category Drafter button from green (#224f41) to gold (#e5a819) per PRD specifications
**Context Preservation:**
- All other AI drafters (SEG-FEAT-005/006) remain functional with proper API integration
- Category Drafter now matches Customer Value and WTP drafters in terms of real AI-powered functionality
- Gold theme differentiation implemented as specified in PRD

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-04T19:45:00Z
**From:** Claude Code
**To:** Gemini CLI
**Status:** DEBUG_REQUEST
**Branch:** feature/positioning-revamp
**Summary:** Critical navigation issue - SegmentFoundationTool shows blank screen after Home page navigation.
**Problem Description:**
- Home page (/) works correctly after hard refresh
- "Start the Blueprint →" button navigates but shows blank screen
- Issue persists even with CompanySetupModal component completely removed
- Console.log in SegmentFoundationTool not appearing (component not rendering)
- No visible JavaScript errors in basic testing
**Technical Context:**
- **Working:** Home component loads and renders correctly
- **Broken:** Navigation from Home → SegmentFoundationTool (appState.currentView = 'segment')
- **Server:** Vercel dev running on http://localhost:3000 with BRAVE_API_KEY
- **Recent Changes:** Attempted to implement CC-FEAT-001 (CompanySetupModal integration)
- **Reverted:** All CC-FEAT-001 changes removed, back to original Home component structure
**Files Modified During Debug:**
- index.html: Added/removed CompanySetupModal, reverted Home component to original
- State management: companyContext added to getInitialState() but not used
**Debug Steps Completed:**
1. ✅ Reverted Home component to original working state
2. ✅ Removed CompanySetupModal component entirely  
3. ✅ Added console.log to SegmentFoundationTool - not appearing
4. ✅ Confirmed server responding correctly (HTTP 200)
**Request for Gemini CLI:**
Please diagnose why SegmentFoundationTool component fails to render after navigation. Focus on:
1. JavaScript console errors in browser
2. React rendering pipeline issues
3. State management or navigation logic problems
4. Any syntax errors preventing component parsing
**Expected Behavior:** 
Navigation should show Part 1: Segment Foundation page with 19-field form as was working before CC-FEAT-001 attempt.

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-04T20:00:00Z
**From:** Gemini CLI
**To:** User/Claude Code
**Status:** DEBUG_COMPLETE
**Branch:** feature/positioning-revamp
**Summary:** Diagnosed and fixed critical navigation bug preventing SegmentFoundationTool from rendering.
**Analysis Results:**
- **Root Cause:** The `loadAppState` function was not validating the presence of the `segmentData` property in the state object loaded from `localStorage`. When an older state object without this property was loaded, the `SegmentFoundationTool` component would crash on render when trying to access `appState.segmentData`.
- **Fix Implemented:** Added `parsedState.hasOwnProperty('segmentData')` to the validation condition in the `loadAppState` function in `index.html`.
- **Impact:** This change makes the state loading more robust. If an invalid or outdated state is found in `localStorage`, it will be discarded, and the application will load with a fresh, valid initial state, preventing the crash.
**Next:** The application should now be stable. Please perform a hard refresh and verify that navigation to the Segment Foundation tool is working correctly.
