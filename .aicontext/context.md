# AI Context for Interactive GTM Blueprint

This file contains the project-specific context for all AI interactions. Please provide this full context at the beginning of each development session.

## Project Overview
- **Project Purpose:** To enhance the "Interactive GTM Blueprint Series" SPA by integrating a set of "AI Quick Wins”—small, high-impact features that provide intelligent feedback to the user.
- **Target Users:** B2B SaaS founders and go-to-market leaders.
- **Key Features:** F-1, F-2, F-3, F-4, F-5, F-6, F-8 (all complete).

## Architecture Decisions (Updated 2025-08-29)

### Core Architecture
- **Frontend:** Single `index.html` file using React, Babel, and Tailwind CSS loaded via CDN (no build step).
- **Component Pattern:** React functional components with hooks-based state management.
- **Data Persistence:** localStorage for application state.

### Serverless Architecture
- **Proxy Layer:** Vercel Functions (`api/search.js`) for CORS-enabled API access.
- **API Provider:** Brave Search API for web search capabilities.

## Development Status (Updated 2025-08-29)

### Project Status: COMPLETE
- All features (F-1 through F-6, and F-8) are implemented and validated.

**From:** Gemini CLI
**To:** User
**Status:** DEPLOYMENT_PLAN_PROPOSED
**Branch:** `feature/ai-quick-wins`
**Summary:** All features are complete and validated. Proposing final steps for production deployment.
**Task Prompt for Final Deployment:** "The project is now feature-complete. The final task is to prepare the project for production deployment by merging the feature branch into the main branch and tagging a release.

**Deployment Steps:**

1.  **Merge to Main:**
    *   Check out the `main` branch.
    *   Merge the `feature/ai-quick-wins` branch into `main`.
    *   Resolve any merge conflicts if they arise.
    *   Push the updated `main` branch to the remote repository.

2.  **Tag Release:**
    *   Create a new git tag for this release, named `v1.1.0` (as F-8 was a significant addition).
    *   Push the new tag to the remote repository.

Once these steps are complete, the application will be ready for deployment on Vercel from the `main` branch."
**Context Preservation:** This is the final step of the development phase. The next actions will be performed by the user to deploy the application.
