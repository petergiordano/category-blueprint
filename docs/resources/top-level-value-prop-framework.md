# Top Level Value Proposition Framework

This document outlines the strategic framework that underpins the Interactive GTM Blueprint application. It serves as the primary reference for all AI agents to understand the application's structure, purpose, and development roadmap.

## 1. FOUNDATION (Inputs)

This quadrant focuses on the core strategic inputs required to define a go-to-market strategy.

* **Who's the ICP?** Defining the Ideal Customer Profile.
* **What's the 'Job to be Done'?** Understanding the customer's underlying motivation and struggle.
* **What are the 'Value Propositions'?** Articulating the core value offered.
* **What's the 'Category'?** Defining the market category in which the product competes.

## 2. POSITIONING (Messaging)

This quadrant translates the foundational inputs into a clear and compelling market position.

* **Competitive Alternatives:** What the customer would use if the product didn't exist.
* **Unique Attributes:** What makes the product different and better than the alternatives.
* **Value & Proof:** The tangible benefits and evidence that support the unique attributes.
* **Market Category:** The frame of reference for the customer to understand the product.

## 3. GTM MOTION (Execution)

This quadrant details the plan for taking the product to market.

* **Targeting & Segmentation:** The specific customer segments to pursue.
* **Messaging & Narrative:** The story and messages used to engage the target segments.
* **Channel & Tactics:** The specific marketing and sales channels to be used.
* **Metrics & Goals:** The KPIs to measure the success of the GTM motion.

## 4. PLAYBOOK (Outputs)

This quadrant represents the tangible assets and processes that result from the GTM strategy.

* **Sales Playbook:** A guide for the sales team on how to sell the product.
* **Marketing Plan:** A detailed plan for all marketing activities.
* **Product Roadmap:** How the GTM strategy influences future product development.
