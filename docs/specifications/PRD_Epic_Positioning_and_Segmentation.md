**Status:** Approved for Implementation

## 1. Objective: The "Klarity" Mandate

Our objective is to transform the GTM Blueprint application from a strategic canvas into an intelligent GTM collaborator. The goal is to build a tool that helps successful, post-product-market-fit companies uncover their latent, most powerful positioning.

We will achieve this by moving beyond a company's *stated* positioning and using AI to discover the true **Job to be Done (JTBD)** of their best customers. The core insight we are building around is the difference between "Company A" (the best customer, who uses a product for a strategic job) and "Company B" (the average customer, who may use it for a tactical job). Our tool must help users find more "Company A's".

## 2. Core Strategic Principles

This epic is governed by the following strategic decisions:

* **A. The GTM Progression Model:** The application will be re-architected to follow a simplified **Segment → ICP → Category Design** progression. The "Early Customer Profile (ECP)" concept will be omitted to reduce cognitive load for growth-stage companies.
* **B. Single Segment Focus:** For this implementation, the tool will focus on defining one primary target segment at a time to enforce strategic discipline and clarity.
* **C. SLC Framework:** All features will be developed as **Simple, Lovable, and Complete** deliverables to provide incremental value.
* **D. Feature Naming Standard:** All work will be tracked using the `[EPIC]-[TYPE]-[SEQ]` naming standard (e.g., `SEG-TASK-001`).

## 3. User Goals

* **UG-1:** As a CEO, I want to move beyond my team's gut feel and use a data-driven approach to understand our best customers.
* **UG-2:** As a GTM leader, I want to clearly see the difference in perceived value between different customer segments.
* **UG-3:** As a product marketer, I want to simulate how different value propositions will land with different ICPs to find our "Winning Zone".
* **UG-4:** As a strategist, I want to uncover the true, underlying JTBD of our target market to build a foundation for durable category leadership.
