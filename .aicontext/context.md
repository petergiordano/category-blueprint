# AI Context for Interactive GTM Blueprint

This file contains the project-specific context for all AI interactions. Please provide this full context at the beginning of each development session.

## Project Overview
- **Project Purpose:** To enhance the "Interactive GTM Blueprint Series" SPA by integrating a set of "AI Quick Wins‚Äù‚Äîsmall, high-impact features that provide intelligent feedback to the user.
- **Target Users:** B2B SaaS founders and go-to-market leaders.
- **Key Features:** F-1 (AI Category Name Brainstormer), F-2 (Value Proposition Grader), F-3 (Competitive Weakness Analysis), F-4 (AI-Assisted JTBD Structuring), F-5 (Uniqueness Attribute Validation), F-6 (Trend Validation), F-7 (Value Prop Hierarchy).

## Architecture Decisions (Updated 2025-08-28)

### Core Architecture
- **Frontend:** Single `index.html` file using React, Babel, and Tailwind CSS loaded via CDN (no build step)
- **Component Pattern:** React functional components with hooks-based state management
- **Data Persistence:** localStorage for application state, no backend database
- **Styling:** Scale Venture Partners brand guidelines with custom CSS classes

### AI Integration Evolution
- **Phase 1 (F-1 to F-4):** Simulated AI responses with realistic algorithms and loading states
- **Phase 2 (F-5 to F-6):** Real external API integration via serverless proxy architecture

### Serverless Architecture (Phase 2)
- **Proxy Layer:** Vercel Functions (`api/search.js`) for CORS-enabled API access
- **API Provider:** Brave Search API for web search capabilities
- **Security Model:** Environment variables in `.env.local`, server-side API key handling
- **Deployment:** Hybrid approach maintaining single-file simplicity with serverless functions

## Development Status (Updated 2025-08-28)

### Phase 1 & 2 Complete (F-1 through F-6)
- All features F-1 through F-6 are implemented and validated.

### Phase 3 Pending (F-7 Implementation)
- **F-7 (Value Prop Hierarchy):** üöß Ready for Implementation - This is the final feature.

### Current Branch Status
- **Active Branch:** `feature/ai-quick-wins`

## Agent Handoff & Status Log
---
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-28T22:10:00Z
**From:** Gemini CLI
**To:** User/Claude Code
**Status:** TASK_ASSIGNED
**Branch:** `feature/ai-quick-wins`
**Summary:** Assigning implementation of the final feature, F-7 (Value Prop Hierarchy Implementation).
**Task Prompt for Claude:** "My apologies for the previous message about deployment. You are correct, we must implement F-7 first. Please proceed with the implementation based on the detailed task list in `docs/specifications/TASK_LIST_AI_Quick_Wins.md`.

**F-7 Implementation Steps:**

1.  **State Management Refactoring:**
    *   Modify `getInitialState` to include a `pillars` array in `positioningData` (e.g., `pillars: [{id: 1, name: '', benefit: ''}]`).
    *   Add a `pillarId` field to the default object in the `values` array (e.g., `values: [{ val1: '', val2: '', val3: '', pillarId: null }]`).
    *   Ensure `loadAppState` correctly handles the new state structure, populating with defaults if missing.

2.  **UI Component Scaffolding:**
    *   Create a new section component, **Section 5: Strategic Pillars**, and insert it after Section 4 (Relevant Trends) in the `PositioningTool` component.
    *   This section should allow users to dynamically add, edit, and remove pillars, similar to the existing `RemovableRow` or `RemovableTriple` components.
    *   Each pillar should have two text fields: "Pillar Name" and "Benefit Statement".

3.  **UI Refactoring:**
    *   Modify the `RemovableTriple` component (now in Section 3, "Value and Proof").
    *   Add a `<select>` dropdown menu to each value trio.
    *   Populate the dropdown options from the `pillars` array in the application state, showing the `Pillar Name`.

4.  **Frontend Logic Implementation:**
    *   Implement an `onChange` handler for the dropdown to assign a `pillarId` to the corresponding value trio.
    *   In the `PositioningTool` component, refactor the rendering logic for Section 3 to first group the `values` by their assigned `pillarId`. Display the Pillar Name as a sub-header for each group.

5.  **Validation:**
    *   Ensure you can add, edit, and remove multiple pillars.
    *   Verify that assigning a value trio to a pillar works correctly and persists in the state.
    *   Confirm that the visual grouping of value trios under their assigned pillars is clear.

Commit all changes to the `feature/ai-quick-wins` branch. Once complete, report back with `READY_FOR_REVALIDATION`."
**Context Preservation:** This is the final feature for the AI Quick Wins project. Upon completion, the entire project will be feature-complete and ready for final review and deployment.
