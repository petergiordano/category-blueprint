# AI Context for Interactive GTM Blueprint

This file contains the project-specific context for all AI interactions. Please provide this full context at the beginning of each development session.

**Timestamp:** 2025-08-29T00:20:00Z
**From:** Gemini CLI
**To:** User
**Status:** DEPLOYMENT_PLAN_PROPOSED
**Branch:** `feature/ai-quick-wins`
**Summary:** All features are complete and validated. Proposing final steps for production deployment.
**Task Prompt for Final Deployment:** "The project is now feature-complete. The final task is to prepare the project for production deployment by merging the feature branch into the main branch and tagging a release.

**Deployment Steps:**

1.  **Merge to Main:**
    *   Check out the `main` branch.
    *   Merge the `feature/ai-quick-wins` branch into `main`.
    *   Resolve any merge conflicts if they arise.
    *   Push the updated `main` branch to the remote repository.

2.  **Tag Release:**
    *   Create a new git tag for this release, named `v1.1.0` (as F-8 was a significant addition).
    *   Push the new tag to the remote repository.

Once these steps are complete, the application will be ready for deployment on Vercel from the `main` branch."
**Context Preservation:** This is the final step of the development phase. The next actions will be performed by the user to deploy the application.

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-03T12:00:00Z
**From:** Gemini CLI
**To:** User/Claude Code
**Status:** ANALYSIS_COMPLETE
**Branch:** feature/positioning-revamp
**Summary:** Reviewed PRD_Epic_Positioning_and_Segmentation.md and index.html in preparation for SEG-TASK-001.
**Analysis Results:** The overall four-phase roadmap is clear. The target file, index.html, is a React SPA. The core task is to introduce a new "Segment" view and refactor the navigation. I have asked the user for clarification on four specific points regarding navigation flow, home page UI, component scaffolding, and component naming before proceeding with implementation.
**Task Prompt for Claude:** None. Awaiting user feedback.
**Context Preservation:** The next step is to receive user feedback on the clarifying questions. The goal is to de-risk the implementation of `SEG-TASK-001`.
