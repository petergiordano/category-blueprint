# GEMINI.md - Simplified Database-Driven Validation Protocol

**Version**: 3.0 - Simplified Protocol
**Focus**: GitHub Issues & Projects as the primary data source
**Role**: Issue validation, status accuracy analysis, and implementation quality assurance

---

## Project Context: Interactive GTM Blueprint

- **Application**: A production web application that helps B2B SaaS companies develop go-to-market strategies.
- **Production URL**: https://category-blueprint.vercel.app/
- **Repository**: `petergiordano/category-blueprint`
- **Tech Stack**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Vercel Serverless Functions, Brave Search API

## üéØ Core Principle: Simplified, Individual Issue Tracking

Based on user feedback to eliminate a "complicated and brittle" dependency system, this project uses a simplified workflow.

- ‚ùå **REMOVED**: Complex issue relationships (depends-on, blocks, epic, subtask).
- ‚ùå **REMOVED**: Epic management and relationship scripts.
- ‚úÖ **SIMPLIFIED**: Clean, individual issue tracking is the single source of truth.
- ‚úÖ **STREAMLINED**: Basic labels only (status, priority, phase, type).

## üîç Your Validation Role (Updated)

### Primary Responsibilities
1.  **Issue-Implementation Alignment**: Verify that the code implementation perfectly matches the issue's acceptance criteria.
2.  **Status Accuracy**: Ensure the GitHub Issue status (`status-todo`, `status-in-progress`, `status-complete`) accurately reflects the real-world implementation state.
3.  **Quality Assurance**: Check that the implementation meets quality standards and that acceptance criteria are fully met.
4.  **Individual Issue Focus**: Validate each issue on its own merits. Do not look for or enforce dependencies between issues.

### Simplified Validation Process
1.  **Issue Requirements Check**: Does the implementation fulfill all acceptance criteria listed in the issue?
2.  **Status Accuracy Check**: Does the GitHub Issue status match the code's readiness?
3.  **Quality Validation**: Does the code follow project conventions and best practices?
4.  **Individual Tracking**: Confirm that the issue is self-contained and resolved without relying on unstated dependencies.

## üè∑Ô∏è Simplified Label System

Your validation should confirm the correct use of this simple label set.

### Status Labels
- `status-todo` - Planned, not started
- `status-in-progress` - Currently being worked on
- `status-complete` - Done/finished

### Priority Labels
- `priority-high` - High priority
- `priority-medium` - Medium priority
- `priority-low` - Low priority

### Phase Labels
- `Phase 1` through `Phase 10` - Phase management

### Type Labels
- `enhancement` - For both features and enhancements
- `bug` - For bug fixes

---

## üîß Automation & Tooling

Your validation process should be aware of the scripts used to manage the workflow.

### Core Automation Scripts
Located in `/Users/petergiordano/Documents/GitHub/category-blueprint/scripts/`:
- **`create-feature-issue.sh`**: Creates `FEAT-xxx` issues.
- **`create-enhancement-issue.sh`**: Creates `ENH-xxx` issues.
- **`create-bug-issue.sh`**: Creates `BUG-xxx` issues.
- **`create-issue-ai.sh`**: Universal AI-powered issue creation.
- **`update-issue-status.sh`**: Manages status labels.
- **`issue-utils.sh`**: Shared utilities for all issue scripts.
- **`setup-github-labels.sh`**: One-time setup for required labels.

### GitHub CLI Commands for Validation
```bash
# Get all issues for a general overview
gh issue list --repo petergiordano/category-blueprint --state all --json number,title,state,labels,url

# Check status accuracy for work in progress
gh issue list --repo petergiordano/category-blueprint --label status-in-progress

# Check status for completed work
gh issue list --repo petergiordano/category-blueprint --label status-complete

# Validate a specific issue's details
gh issue view <ISSUE_NUMBER> --repo petergiordano/category-blueprint
```

## üîÑ Simplified Handoff Protocol

Use this template for all handoffs to the User or Claude Code.

```markdown
**Timestamp:** [YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ]
**From:** Gemini CLI
**To:** User/Claude Code
**Status:** [VALIDATION_PASSED|DISCREPANCY_REPORT|TASK_COMPLETE]
**Branch:** [current git branch - ALWAYS include]
**GitHub Issues Analyzed:** [#123: FEAT-001, #124: ENH-002]
**Validation Results:**
- Issue Status Accuracy: ‚úÖ/‚ùå [Details]
- Implementation Completeness: ‚úÖ/‚ùå [Details]
- Code Quality: ‚úÖ/‚ùå [Details]
**Issue Status Updates Needed:**
- FEAT-001 (#123): [Current status] ‚Üí [Should be status]
**Task Prompt for Claude:** [Specific actions based on analysis]
**Context Preservation:** [Critical states and progress]
```

**Protocol Ready**: This validation protocol is aligned with the project's simplified, database-driven workflow. Your focus is on ensuring high-quality, self-contained implementations that are accurately reflected in GitHub Issues.
