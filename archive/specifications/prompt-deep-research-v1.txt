### II. The True Voice of the Customer & Unarticulated Needs

**1. Key Insight, Hypothesis, Anomaly, or Observation:**
Customers consistently express frustration not with the *lack* of data, but with the *inability to collaborate* on it in real-time, suggesting the core Job to be Done is more about "achieving team alignment" than "generating reports."

**2. Supporting Evidence & Sources:**
* Evidence: *“We had five analysts pulling the same data and coming to different conclusions. The problem wasn't the data, it was that we couldn't get on the same page.”* [Source: G2 Review, 2025-09-10]
* Evidence: A forum post describes a customer "hack" where they screen-share a dashboard over Zoom for an hour just to ensure everyone is looking at the same numbers. [Source: "Data Nerds" Subreddit, 2025-08-22]

**3. "So what?" -- Implication for [Company Name]:**
This implies that messaging focused solely on "powerful analytics" may miss the mark. The more resonant message is likely centered on "collaborative decision-making" and "a single source of truth for your team."

**4. "Breakthrough Spark" (Highlight if applicable):**
**BREAKTHROUGH SPARK:** [Company Name] could position itself not as an analytics tool, but as a "Collaborative Intelligence Platform," creating a new category niche that sidesteps the crowded analytics market.

**5. Relevant Strategic Element(s):**
Category Definition & Leadership Opportunity, Competitive Positioning & Defense Strategy.
