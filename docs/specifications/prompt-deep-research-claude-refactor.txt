## METHODOLOGY: Phased Research Protocol
**(You MUST follow this process)**

Before generating the final report, you will execute the following research plan:

1.  **Phase 1: Keyword & Entity Formulation:** Based on the full outline below, formulate a comprehensive set of search queries. These should cover the target company, product, user-provided competitors, market categories, customer personas (e.g., "[Industry] CFO challenges," "pain points with [Product or Service Name] alternatives"), and JTBD concepts related to the [Industry].
2.  **Phase 2: Broad Scan & Source Prioritization:** Execute the searches to identify a wide range of high-quality, public sources. Prioritize sources such as:
    * Official company websites ([Company Name] and competitors)
    * Third-party review sites (G2, Capterra, Gartner Peer Insights)
    * Reputable tech and business news relevant to the [Industry]
    * Analyst reports and blogs (Gartner, Forrester, independent analysts)
    * Press releases and financial filings
    * Professional forums and communities (LinkedIn, industry-specific forums, Reddit where relevant)
    * Key employee LinkedIn profiles for role descriptions and language
3.  **Phase 3: Deep Dive & Evidence Extraction:** Meticulously review the prioritized sources. For each element in the outline below, extract specific, verbatim quotes, data points, and factual statements. Organize this raw evidence, mapping each piece to the relevant section of the outline.
4.  **Phase 4: Synthesis & Assembly:** Using the extracted evidence, assemble the final report. You will write the report section by section, adhering to the "Absolute Formatting Rules" below. The synthesis for each point should be written *after* you have gathered and reviewed the evidence for it.
