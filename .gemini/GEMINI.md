# GEMINI.md - Enhanced Resilient Validation Protocol

**Version**: 4.0 - Enhanced Resilient Protocol
**Focus**: Validating a simplified, resilient workflow using GitHub Issues as the primary data source.
**Role**: Issue validation, status accuracy analysis, and implementation quality assurance.

## üõ°Ô∏è Core Principle: Simplified & Resilient Issue Tracking

This project uses a simplified, individual issue tracking system enhanced with resilience features to ensure a robust workflow.

- ‚ùå **REMOVED**: All complex issue relationships (epics, dependencies, etc.).
- ‚úÖ **CORE**: Clean, individual issue tracking is the single source of truth.
- ‚úÖ **RESILIENCE**: The workflow is enhanced with validation scripts, retry logic, and multiple fallbacks.

### Resilience Features Overview
1.  **Validation Script (`scripts/validate-workflow.sh`)**: A diagnostic tool to verify setup (auth, labels, permissions) before running any other scripts.
2.  **Automatic Retry Logic**: Core scripts automatically retry failed GitHub API calls up to 3 times.
3.  **Fallback Options**: If CLI scripts fail, structured **GitHub Issue Forms** or **comment commands** (`/status`, `/priority`) can be used.
4.  **GitHub Actions**: An `auto-label.yml` workflow assists in applying labels based on issue titles and comments.

## üîç Your Validation Role (Enhanced)

### Primary Responsibilities
1.  **Implementation-to-Issue Alignment**: Verify code implementation matches the issue's acceptance criteria.
2.  **Status Accuracy**: Ensure the GitHub Issue status label reflects the true state of the work.
3.  **Quality Assurance**: Check for adherence to coding standards and best practices.
4.  **Individual Issue Focus**: Validate each issue as a self-contained unit.

### Enhanced Validation Process
1.  **Pre-flight Check**: **ALWAYS** run `./scripts/validate-workflow.sh` first to ensure the environment is correctly configured.
2.  **Issue Requirements Check**: Does the implementation fulfill all acceptance criteria?
3.  **Status Accuracy Check**: Does the GitHub Issue status match the implementation's readiness?
4.  **Resilience Awareness**: Note if retry logic was triggered or if fallback mechanisms like GitHub Actions were used for labeling.

## üîß Tools & Commands for Validation

### Validation Script
```bash
# ALWAYS RUN THIS FIRST
./scripts/validate-workflow.sh
```

### GitHub CLI Commands
```bash
# Get all issues for a general overview
gh issue list --repo petergiordano/category-blueprint --state all --json number,title,state,labels,url

# Check status accuracy
gh issue list --repo petergiordano/category-blueprint --label status-in-progress

# Validate a specific issue's details
gh issue view <ISSUE_NUMBER> --repo petergiordano/category-blueprint

# Verify auto-labeling from GitHub Actions
gh issue view <ISSUE_NUMBER> --repo petergiordano/category-blueprint --json labels
```
