# AI Context for Interactive GTM Blueprint

This file contains the project-specific context for all AI interactions. Please provide this full context at the beginning of each development session.

## Project Overview
- **Project Purpose:** To enhance the "Interactive GTM Blueprint Series" SPA by integrating a set of "AI Quick Wins‚Äù‚Äîsmall, high-impact features that provide intelligent feedback to the user.
- **Target Users:** B2B SaaS founders and go-to-market leaders.
- **Key Features:** F-1 (AI Category Name Brainstormer), F-2 (Value Proposition Grader), F-3 (Competitive Weakness Analysis), F-4 (AI-Assisted JTBD Structuring), F-5 (Uniqueness Attribute Validation), F-6 (Trend Validation).

## Architecture Decisions
- **Technology Stack:** The entire application is a single `index.html` file using React, Babel, and Tailwind CSS loaded via CDN. There is no build step.
- **Design Patterns:** Component-based architecture within a single file. State is managed via React hooks and persisted to localStorage.
- **Integration Approaches:** AI features will be implemented via client-side JavaScript, simulating API calls initially.

## Development Status

- **Completed Components:** Features F-1 (AI Category Name Brainstormer), F-2 (Value Proposition Grader), F-3 (Competitive Weakness Analysis), and F-4 (AI-Assisted JTBD Structuring) have been successfully implemented and validated.
- **Active Development Area:** Phase 1 AI Quick Wins (F-1, F-2, F-3, F-4) are complete. Ready to begin Phase 2 with F-5 (Uniqueness Attribute Validation) or F-6 (Trend Validation). All work is on the `feature/ai-quick-wins` git branch.
- **Planned Features:** F-5 and F-6 require web search API integration and represent Phase 2 of the AI Quick Wins implementation.

## Lessons Learned
- **Implementation Insights:** Parallel development with multiple AI Implementers in a single, shared workspace can lead to git state conflicts (e.g., incorrect branch usage). A sequential, single-Implementer workflow is more reliable for this setup.
- **Best Practices:** All coding tasks should begin with creating a dedicated feature branch and end with a commit to that branch.

## AI Coordination Notes
- **Effective Prompting:** Use this context file as a prefix for every new session with an Implementer. Follow up with a single, clear, step-by-step prompt for the immediate task.
- **Workflow:** We are manually executing the cycle described in `WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`. Our current actions are equivalent to the implementation phase for the `@next-task`.

**Task Prompt for Claude:** "Your next task is to prepare for the implementation of Features F-5 (Uniqueness Attribute Validation) and F-6 (Trend Validation). Both features require web search API integration. Your first step is to research and identify a suitable web search API (e.g., Brave Search or similar) that can be integrated into the existing `index.html` structure. Investigate its capabilities, potential integration methods (e.g., client-side fetch, serverless function if necessary), and any API key requirements. Document your findings and propose a plan for integrating this API to support F-5 and F-6. Focus on a solution that aligns with the project's single-file, client-side architecture as much as possible. Commit your findings and proposed plan to the `feature/ai-quick-wins` branch."
**Context Preservation:** All Phase 1 and 2 features (F-1 to F-4) are implemented and validated. The project is now transitioning to Phase 3, focusing on external API integration.

**Timestamp:** 2025-08-28T17:05:00Z
**From:** Gemini CLI
**To:** User/Claude Code
**Status:** DISCREPANCY_REPORT
**Branch:** feature/ai-quick-wins
**Validation Summary:**
- ‚úÖ Passed: Initial textual validation based on summaries.
- ‚ùå Issues Found: 1

**Discrepancies Found:**
1. **Issue Type:** JavaScript Syntax Error
   **Specifics:** Extraneous newline escape sequences (`\n`) are present directly within the JavaScript code of the `removeItem` function (around line 1179 in `index.html`). This causes a `SyntaxError` and prevents the script from executing.
   **Impact:** Feature F-4 (AI-Assisted JTBD Structuring) is not functional, and the entire application is unusable due to the script not parsing.
   **Recommended Action:** Remove the invalid `\n` characters from the `removeItem` function in `index.html`. The corrected code for the `setAnalysisState` block within `removeItem` should be:
```javascript
                    });
                    setAnalysisState(prev => {
                        const newState = { ...prev };
                        delete newState[index];
                        return newState;
                    });
```
   After applying the fix, verify that `index.html` renders correctly and that the `removeItem` functionality works as expected. Report back with `READY_FOR_REVALIDATION`.

**From:** Gemini CLI
**To:** User/Claude Code
**Status:** TASK_ASSIGNED
**Branch:** feature/ai-quick-wins
**Summary:** Phase 2A research is validated and complete. Assigning Phase 2B: Implementation of the serverless proxy and Feature F-5.
**Analysis Results:** The plan to use a Vercel Function as a proxy for the Brave Search API is approved. The `api` directory has been created.
**Task Prompt for Claude:** "Your next task is to implement the serverless proxy and begin integrating Feature F-5 (Uniqueness Attribute Validation).

**Phase 2B Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Create Serverless Function:**
    *   Create a new file at `api/search.js`.
    *   Inside `search.js`, write a Node.js Vercel serverless function. This function will act as an API proxy.
    *   It should accept a `query` parameter from the request body.
    *   It must securely fetch the `BRAVE_API_KEY` from environment variables (it should not be hardcoded).
    *   It will then make a request to the Brave Search API (`https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search`) with the user's query and the API key in the `X-Subscription-Token` header.
    *   The function should return the JSON response from the Brave API directly to the client.
    *   Ensure you set the appropriate CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, etc.) to allow requests from the application's domain.

2.  **Update Vercel Configuration:**
    *   Modify `vercel.json` to ensure the `/api/search` route is correctly configured to point to your new serverless function. Add a `rewrites` rule if necessary.

3.  **Implement Client-Side Integration (F-5):**
    *   In `index.html`, locate the `RemovableTriple` component used in Section 4 for "Truly Unique Attribute".
    *   Add a new button next to the attribute input field labeled "Analyze Uniqueness".
    *   When this button is clicked, it should trigger a new function, `analyzeUniqueness(attribute)`.
    *   This function will make a `fetch` call to your new `/api/search` endpoint, sending the attribute's text as the query.
    *   Implement loading and error states, similar to the other AI features.
    *   Upon receiving a successful response, display the search results in a simple, readable format below the attribute. For now, just display the titles and snippets of the top 3 results.

Commit all changes to the `feature/ai-quick-wins` branch."
**Context Preservation:** The application is stable. This task introduces the first piece of server-side infrastructure via a serverless function, moving from simulated AI to real API integration.
